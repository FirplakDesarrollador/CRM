  Creating an optimized production build ...
Ô¿» ERROR: This build is 
using Turbopack, with a 
`webpack` config and no 
`turbopack` config.
   This may be a mistake.

   As of Next.js 16 
Turbopack is enabled by 
default and
   custom webpack 
configurations may need to 
be migrated to Turbopack.

   NOTE: your `webpack` 
config may have been added 
by a configuration plugin.

   To configure Turbopack, 
see https://nextjs.org/docs/
app/api-reference/next-confi
g-js/turbopack

   TIP: Many applications 
work fine under Turbopack 
with no configuration,
   if that is the case for 
you, you can silence this 
error by passing the
   `--turbopack` or 
`--webpack` flag explicitly 
or simply setting an 
   empty turbopack config 
in your Next config file 
(e.g. `turbopack: {}`).
